Submitted by: **Luke Burbidge**

Time spent: **4.5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] UI animations
* [x] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)

## Notes

Just mostly getting used to the nuances of XCode's interface builder. Certain UI elements (like the list picker in the settings menu) took a different approach to configuration than I thought it would at first glance.
